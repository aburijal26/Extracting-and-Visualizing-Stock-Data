# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

This is a Python project developed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project involves extracting and visualizing stock data using different sources.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages installed:

1. 'pandas'
2. 'yfinance'
3. 'BeautifulSoup4'
4. 'requests'

## Usage
To run the project, open the Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run the code cells.

The project consists of six sections, each corresponding to one of the questions listed in the project instructions. The sections are as follows:

1. Extracting Tesla Stock Data Using yfinance
2. Extracting Tesla Revenue Data Using Webscraping
3. Extracting GameStop Stock Data Using yfinance
4. Extracting GameStop Revenue Data Using Webscraping
5. Tesla Stock and Revenue Dashboard
6. GameStop Stock and Revenue Dashboard

For sections 1, 3, 5, and 6, the notebook will generate a stock price dashboard using data extracted from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance package. For sections 2 and 4, the notebook will extract revenue data from the Tesla and GameStop websites using webscraping with BeautifulSoup4 and requests.
